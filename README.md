## IT just for share the git knowledge

i only use it personaly with commit, push, pull.
As a old noob, i should learn to share what i did and learn more here.

Today i found something intresting.  
I want to check whether i have commited, but i didnot see contributions.
As a noob, i want find a easy way to learn it.  Python is easier to learn, and i had some experience in C++, although 4 years ago.  

Git is a friendly platform for us to see how big the world is, how much big asses here.
